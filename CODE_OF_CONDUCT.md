## ** Our Pledge**

As members of this project, we recognize that a successful and productive team thrives on mutual respect, collaboration, and accountability. We pledge to create an environment where every member feels heard, valued, and empowered to contribute their best work. We commit to fostering a culture of learning, adaptability, and shared responsibility, ensuring that our project is not only a technical success but also a positive and inclusive experience for all involved. We hold ourselves accountable to these values and will work together to uphold them throughout the duration of this project.

## **Statement on Diversity and Inclusivity**

We are committed to fostering an inclusive and respectful environment where all individuals — regardless of background, identity, or experience — can collaborate, learn, and contribute meaningfully to our project. Our community values diversity and recognizes that a broad range of perspectives enhances innovation and problem-solving. Discrimination, harassment, or exclusion of any kind will not be tolerated.

## **Expected Behavior**

All members of the project team are expected to:

- Communicate respectfully and professionally at all times.
- Actively listen and consider differing viewpoints.
- Provide constructive feedback and accept it graciously.
- Contribute to discussions and tasks in a meaningful, honest, and collaborative manner.
- Acknowledge and credit the work of others appropriately.
- Support and uplift team members, ensuring an equitable distribution of workload.
- Respect deadlines and responsibilities to maintain the integrity of the project.
- Contribute a fair amount of work that reflects their capabilities.

## **Unacceptable Behavior**

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- Discriminatory comments or actions based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, disability, or any other characteristic.
- Harassment, including but not limited to, personal attacks, intimidation, or bullying.
- Inappropriate or offensive language, including sexualized or derogatory remarks.
- Disrupting group discussions or project workflow.
- Plagiarism, misrepresentation of contributions, or failure to credit others' work.
- Unauthorized sharing of project-related confidential data or discussions.
- Repeated failure to meet agreed-upon responsibilities without proper communication.

## **Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior**

Violation of this Code of Conduct will result in appropriate consequences, which may include the following, depending on the severity and frequency of the behavior:

### **1. First and Second Warning**
- A private discussion with the project lead to clarify the nature of the violation and provide guidance on expected behavior.
- A request for a formal acknowledgment of the issue and a commitment to improved conduct.

### **2. Discussion with a TA (Third Warning)**
- If unacceptable behavior continues after two warnings, the individual will be required to meet with a Teaching Assistant (TA) to discuss the issue in detail.
- The TA may recommend additional corrective actions, such as additional accountability measures or mediation with affected team members.

### **3. Discussion with Professor Chen**
- In cases of severe misconduct or repeated violations, the group will have to consult with the course instructor.
- This may result in removal from the project and/or serious detriment to project grade.

## **Reporting and Enforcement Procedures**

### **How to Report an Issue**

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, you should:
- Report the issue directly to the group chat (on Instagram).
- If the issue still is not resolved, or there is a repeat, report to the TA.
- Reports should include a clear description of the incident, any evidence (if available), and the names of any witnesses.

### **Handling Reports**

All reports will be handled with fairness:
- The TA or instructor will conduct an initial review of the complaint.
- The individual accused of the violation will be given an opportunity to provide their perspective.
- A decision will be made in consultation with relevant academic personnel if necessary.
- Follow-up actions will be taken, including regular check-ins to ensure the resolution of the issue.

### **No Retaliation Policy**

Retaliation against anyone who reports a violation or participates in an investigation is strictly prohibited. Any attempt to intimidate or penalize a person for reporting misconduct will itself be treated as a serious violation of this Code of Conduct.

## **Final Notes**

This Code of Conduct is a living document and may be updated as needed to ensure it remains effective and relevant to the project community. All team members are encouraged to provide feedback on how we can improve our commitment to an inclusive and respectful working environment.
